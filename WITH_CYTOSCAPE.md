# With Cytoscape

In order to explore more dynamic scenarios I'm attempting to integrate with [Cytoscape](https://js.cytoscape.org) as well.
This will be more relevant:

1. cytoscape allows manipulation and scripting over time (not yet done)
2. to set additional constraints via [cola](https://ialab.it.monash.edu/webcola/) layout (not yet done)

Check the [demo](https://josepedrodias.github.io/parenthood/public/cytoscape/demo.html).

This is integration is brand new and just a draft.

## reference

- [cytoscape docs](https://js.cytoscape.org)
- [webcola](https://ialab.it.monash.edu/webcola/) (not yet in use)
